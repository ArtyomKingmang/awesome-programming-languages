# Awesome Programming Languages articles
If you are interested in programming languages, probably you are writing your own PL (or wish to write). Then this place is for you.
This is the list of awesome PL articles that you might be helpful. Also it's the place to look for a new ideas and inspiration. Feel free to make a contribution.
If you are bloging about your PL you are also welcome.
