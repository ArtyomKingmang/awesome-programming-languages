- [TableM](https://github.com/Tablam/TablaM) - A relational language.
- [Tao](https://github.com/zesterer/tao) - A statically-typed functional language with polymorphism, typeclasses, sum types, pattern-matching, first-class functions, currying, good diagnostics, and much more!
- [Tlön](https://github.com/nesteruk/Tlon) - Tlön is a programming language transpiled into Modern C++. These are the key goals:
  * Add features which C++ is missing.
  * Throw out all the legacy crap that's been dragged into C++ over the years.
  * Also, just simplify things.
  * Provide a sensible API over Standard Library/STL.
  * Other lofty goals :)
# U (5):
- [Ü](https://github.com/Panzerschrek/U-00DC-Sprache) - Experimental programming language that is compilable, statically-typed C++-like language.
- [Umka](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang) - Umka is a statically typed embeddable scripting language. It combines the simplicity and flexibility needed for scripting with a compile-time protection against type errors. Its aim is to follow the Python Zen principle Explicit is better than implicit more consistently than dynamically typed languages generally do.
- [Unicon](https://github.com/uniconproject/unicon) - Unicon is a very high level programming language. It runs on many operating systems including most Linux distributions, Windows, macOS, and BSD systems. It also supports most modern CPU architectures such as i386, amd64, armhf, arm64, and ppc64el.
- [Unison](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison) - Unison is a modern, statically-typed purely functional language, similar to Haskell, but with the ability to describe entire distributed systems with a single program.
- [Ur](https://github.com/urweb/urweb) - Ur is a programming language in the tradition of ML and Haskell, but featuring a significantly richer type system. Ur is functional, pure, statically typed, and strict. Ur supports a powerful kind of metaprogramming based on row types.
# V (4):
- [V](https://github.com/vlang/v) - Simple, fast, safe, compiled language for developing maintainable software. Compiles itself in <1s with zero library dependencies.
- [Vale](https://github.com/Verdagon/Vale) - Vale is the fast, safe, and easy programming language. It uses single ownership with constraint references for memory safety without garbage collection, and an emphasis on modern, readable syntax.
- [Virgil](https://github.com/titzer/virgil) - A Fast and Lightweight Programming Language. Its design blends functional and object-oriented programming paradigms for expressiveness without a lot of overhead, either syntactically or at runtime. Its implementation is focused primarily on static compilation to produce native executables that are standalone. It is well-suited to writing small and fast programs. That makes it ideal for building certain kinds of programs like compilers and virtual machines. It is currently being used for virtual machine and programming language research.
- [Vox](https://github.com/MrSmith33/vox) - Vox is a multiparadigm programming language inspired by D (60%), Jai (30%), and Zig (10%). Vox language compiler. AOT / JIT / Linker. Zero dependencies
# W (2):
- [Wu](https://github.com/wu-lang/wu) - An expression oriented, gradually typed and mission-critical programming language.
- [Wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren) - Wren is a small, fast, class-based concurrent scripting language.
# X:
# Y:
# Z (2):
- [Zenon](https://github.com/miki151/zenon) - Zenon is a statically typed language that compiles to C++. It offers safe and easy application development thanks to high-level features and fast compile times, while keeping C++'s performance and familiar syntax.
- [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) - General-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.
