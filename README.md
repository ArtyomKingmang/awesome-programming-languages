The supported programming paradigms are imperative, object-oriented, declarative using nested structures, functional and natural programming. The language is portable (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.) and can be used to create Console and GUI. The language is designed to be simple, small, flexible and fast..
# E: 
- [Enact](https://github.com/enact-lang/enact) - Enact is a new compiled general-purpose programming language that's not designed to be unique or groundbreaking. Instead, Enact aims to be familiar, taking advantage of already established techniques and paradigms and making them nicer.
# F:

  * Fast: no garbage-collection, optimal beta-reduction, massively parallel compilers.
  * Secure: a powerful type system capable of proving mathematical theorems.
  * Portable: the entire language desugars to a 500 lines core type-theory.
- [Futhark](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark) - High-performance purely functional data-parallel array programming on the GPU. Futhark is a small programming language designed to be compiled to efficient parallel code. It is a statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional array language in the ML family, and comes with a heavily optimising ahead-of-time compiler that presently generates GPU code via CUDA and OpenCL, although the language itself is hardware-agnostic and can also run on multicore CPUs.

It is still in development and as of yet is unavailable to the general public. Blow developed it with an eye towards video games, but in fact it’s a general purpose programming language that could be used for any task.
- [Juvix](https://github.com/metastatedev/juvix) - A more elegant language for a more civilized age. Juvix synthesizes a high-level frontend syntax, dependent-linearly-typed core language, whole-program optimisation system, and backend-swappable execution model into a single unified stack for writing formally verifiable, efficiently executable smart contracts which can be deployed to a variety of distributed ledgers.

- [Keli](https://github.com/KeliLanguage/compiler) - Keli is a general purpose programming language where its semantics are mostly based on the pure functional programming model (as of Haskell's) which includes user-defined algebraic datatypes, case matching and higher-order functions, while its syntactic structure is strongly influenced by Smalltalk's message sending syntax, such as the unary, binary and keywords messages.
- [Kit](https://github.com/kitlang/kit) - Kit is a programming language designed for creating concise, high performance cross-platform applications. Kit compiles to C, so it's highly portable; it can be used in addition to or as an alternative to C, and was designed with game development in mind.
# L:

# Q: 
# R: 
- [Red](https://github.com/red/red) - Red is a next-generation programming language strongly inspired by Rebol, but with a broader field of usage thanks to its native-code compiler, from system programming to high-level scripting and cross-platform reactive GUI, while providing modern support for concurrency, all in a zero-install, zero-config, single 1MB file!

It also has a few ideas of its own, like an interesting argument passing mechanism and a relatively novel take on OO. Spry is dynamically typed and while trying to recreate the "feeling" of Smalltalk this is an experiment in trying out "interesting" approaches.
